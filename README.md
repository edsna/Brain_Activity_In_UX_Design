This repository contains a sample psychopy code designed to measure targeted brain activity in UX Design.

The code presented here resembles only one set of targetted brain activity in a specific UX Design. It is a result of a combination of results from a research paper on "The Applications of Psychology in UX Design" as well as on-going brain scanning experiments using EEG.

Due to confidentiality limitations, all data resources used in this study where not published including the research paper however, I'm more than happy to answer any questions you might have, don't exitate to reach out.
